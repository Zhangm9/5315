      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. While, containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. </p>
      Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application. In addition, Docker is an open source that anyone can contribute to and extend it to meet their own needs if they need additional features that aren't available out of the box. Last but not least, Docker brings security to applications running in a shared environment, but containers by themselves are not an alternative to taking proper security measures.  </p>

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>NGINX is open source software, which has some common features such as web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, handling of static files, index files, and auto-indexing, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers. </p>
      NGINX is built to offer low memory usage and high concurrency. Rather than creating new processes for each web request, NGINX uses an asynchronous, event-driven approach where requests are handled in a single thread. With NGINX, one master process can control multiple worker processes. The master maintains the worker processes, while the workers do the actual processing. Because NGINX is asynchronous, each request can be executed by the worker concurrently without blocking other requests.</p>

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      A virtual machine is a software computer that, like a physical computer, runs an operating system and applications. The virtual machine is comprised of a set of specification and configuration files and is backed by the physical resources of a host. Every virtual machine has virtual devices that provide the same functionality as physical hardware and have additional benefits in terms of portability, manageability, and security.</p>
      Specialized software (hypervisor), emulates the PC client or server's CPU, memory, hard disk, network and other hardware resources completely, enabling virtual machines to share the resources. The hypervisor can emulate multiple virtual hardware platforms that are isolated from each other, allowing virtual machines to run Linux and Windows Server operating systems on the same underlying physical host. Virtual machines more efficiently use hardware, which lowers the quantities of hardware and associated maintenance costs, and reduces power and cooling demand. They also ease management because virtual hardware does not fail. Administrators can take advantage of virtual environments to simplify backups, disaster recovery, new deployments and basic system administration tasks.</p>

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p> A cloud provider is a company that offers some component of cloud computing – typically Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) – to other businesses or individuals. </p>
      DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider that offer datablse storage, computer power among other functionalities. It provides the easiest cloud platform to deploy, manage, and scale applications of any size, removing infrastructure friction and providing predictability so developers and their teams can spend more time building better software. DigitalOcean has some key advantages such as the easiest cloud platform to run and scale applications, predictable and affordable pricing, high-performance virtual servers and so on. To deploy DigitalOcean's Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment, developers launch a private virtual machine (VM) instance, which DigitalOcean calls a "droplet." Developers use the DigitalOcean manage and monitor their droplets with a control panel and an open source API. The control panel allows developers to scale and rebuild droplets based on workload changes and perform backups and redirect network traffic between droplets.</p>
